<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Feedback was positive overall for most design elements regarding layout, usability, and functionality. All of the evaluators stated that the site had good spacing, clear navigation, and excellent contrast and readability. Lower scores were recorded in regards to content. All of the evaluators commented that the site lacked enough content to provide a stimulating experience or to warrant a return visit. Several evaluators stated the website was bland and could use more color. One evaluator stated that the website could use more "oomph". Mostly positive scores were recorded in regards to credibility, with the category of exception being spelling and grammar. There were no errors or critical issues recorded by the evaluators during the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h4>Use Case 1 - Contacting Author</h4>
<p>There were not issues recorded regarding this use case. All users successfully identified the email link in the footer of each page.</p>
<br>
<h4>Use Case 2 - Viewing Events</h4>
<p>This use case involved proper navigation and the ability to view an event using the hyperlinks given on the page. There were no issues recorded regarding this use case. Positive feedback was received based on the sites navigation.</p>
<br>
<h4>Use Case 3 - CV</h4>
<p>This use case involved navigating to the CV and successfully viewing the data. This use case was successful in terms of functionality, however it fell short in its designed purpose to convey a professional site that targets the audience due to issues with spelling and grammar.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, the site successfully supported the use cases mentioned above. Functionality was successful and did not yield and technical issues. None of the use cases were abandoned due to lack of time or skill.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Planned Design Changes</h2>

<p>The biggest planned design change is to add a more content driven News page. Originally, this  
page was thought to link to content with a quick blurb associated with it. Now, this page will embed
or insert videos and images with the related news. This is based on the low scores received by evaluators in the areas of content. Specifically, adding more "oomph" and making the website more thought provoking or revisit able. I would also like to add the news page as a floating pane on the home page if given the time to learn how to do so.</p>
<p>One area that received low scores and suggestions that will not be changed is the visual esthetics. Although some evaluators stated the site could use more color or graphics, I found most websites that target my audience and are similar in purpose used the same clean and simple layout and colors.</p>

<hr>	  
 <h2>Reflections on Evaluation</h2>
   <p>I found the evaluation process to be quite useful. There were elements to my web site that I did not perceive would have issues and was surprised to see some of the responses. The evaluation helped me find the blind spots in my own perception of the audiences needs as the responses were valid in most cases. I thought that selecting real co-workers and a manager to act as peers and an employer would directly correlate to my audiences. However, that does not appear to be that case in this evaluation as I think they missed the mark on putting themselves in the shoes of viewing the site as a user and not as a developer. Perhaps I should have been more clear in my instructions or more selective of the evaluators.</p>
<p> I believe that the survey was the most useful method for this evaluation. Had my website been larger or more technical, I would have seen a need for observation. Had there been a need to run multiple reviews or get more specific details I could see the need for interviews.</p>
