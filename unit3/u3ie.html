<h3>Topic 1 - Navigation Bars</h3>
<p>It will be important for my page to have a clean navigation bar with proper spacing, font size, and style. It has been a long time since I have created a navigation bar using code. When I did, I dont recal adding any spacing or applying specific font settings. A great tutorial for this was found on the W3 Schools <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp">How to Create a Top Navigation Bar </a>website. </p>
<p> I hope to leverage these techniques in my final website!</P>
<h3>Topic 2 - Link using an Image</h3>
<p> Adding a hyperlink to text is great, but I would like to add a hyperlink to an image. A picture can be worth a thousad words and would be much more useful for sending someone to a website to purchase a product. A good example of this can be found on Viclav Smils'<a href="http://vaclavsmil.com/category/books/">  Books </a>webpage.  </p>
<p>I believe adding hyperlinks to an image would improve my website in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve Visual Appeal</li>
  <li>Appear More Professional</li>
  <li>Provide a Clean Layout</li>
  </ul>
