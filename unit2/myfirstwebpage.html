<h1>My H1 is my title</h1>


<p>Hello, Class! My name is Ian. This is block is surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block level element.</p>
    
<p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but they state that there is a meaning change. For example, <b>this text is emphasized by making it bold.</b> Sometimes we may choose to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it</u>.</p>
    
<h2>My Lists. This is an H2 header; it is a subheading underneath H1.</h2>
    
<h3>Unordered Lists (h3 heading) </h3>
    
<p> We can also make lists. Here is an example of a bulleted (unordered) grocery list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Cereal</li>
</ul>	 
    
<h3>Ordered Lists (h3 heading) </h3>
    
<p> Or sometimes I want to make a list, but it is numbered (ordered list) instead. For example, the first three things I need to do today, in order are:</p>
    
<ol>
    <li>Brush teeth</li>
    <li>Eat breakfast</li>
    <li>Take child to preschool</li>
</ol>	
    
<h2> (h2 heading) </h2>
    
<p> I can also link to different things. For example, I can go to <a href="http://google.com">Google.com</a> by going to <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>. This is an absolute link because it has the entire URL listed there. If I were to link to something locally on my server relative to this file, it would be a relative link. But we'll link to that type of page next time.</p>
    
<h2>Inline styling with colors (h2 heading) </h2>
    
<p> I can also color text using inline styling, but for the most part it is really best to use styling that is done in the header or using an external stylesheet. But we will worry about doing that next time. Here I am making text <span style="color: #00FF00;">green</span>, <span style="color:#FF0000;">red</span>, or <span style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span>. It is really easy to insert a new color. There are lots of places to look for colors. You could go here <a href="http://google.com">color-hex.com</a>, for example, at <a href="http://google.com">http://www.color-hex.com/</a>.</p>
    
<p>This is all for now. I made my first page!</p>
