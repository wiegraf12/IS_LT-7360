<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>Four people completed the purpose questionnaire below. Of these four: two were fellow instructors  
acting as the peer audience, one was the campus manager acting as the hiring agent, and one was a family member  
currently enrolled as a college undergrad acting as the student.
</p>
<h3>Website Purpose Questionnaire:</h3>
<p>Review the following <a href="http://vaclavsmil.com/">website</a>, then answer the questions below:</P>
<ol>
<i>
<li>What reason would most likely cause you to visit this website?
<li>How often do you believe you would visit this website?
<li>Which content were you most interested in?
<li>Is there any content missing that you would have liked to see?
<li>Did you find the information accessible? Was the website easy to navigate?
</i></ol>
<blockquote>Responses were generally the same across the target audience. Most users stated that they would use  
the website to find out more information about sites subject, making the bio/cv page also the most interesting content. One of the interviewees stated that they would also use the site to contact the subject. One interviewee stated  they liked that the site provided recent industry news relating the subjectâ€™s expertise. All interviewees stated they would only visit the website one time only. All users found the website easy to navigate and  
accessible.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of my final website is to brand and market myself by providing information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>bio or CV
<li>events
<li>publications
<li>industry news
<li>contact information
</ul>
<p> This would be used by individuals who are interested in my work and may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students
<li>Co-Workers
<li>Employers
<li>Industry Professionals
</ul>
<p>The idea is that users of my site would visit to gain information about me, my work history, relevant industry news, and how to contact me.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Use Case 1</h3>
<p>A former student would like to conatact me to ask about opportunities. After loading the home page the student uses the email hyperlink located in the footer of the page. The student clicks the active email hyperlink, opening a new message with my email address. Surveys suggest a page with just contact information would not be useful and to move the content below all pages.</p>
<h3>Use Case 2</h3>
<p>A peer would like to see a list of seminars and confrences I will be attending. After loading the home page they uses the navigation bar located below the header banner and above the main content to navigate to the events page. The page loads with a bulleted list of events with dates. The listed text contain hyperlinks, when clicked send the user to the website for the selected event.</p>
<h3>Use Case 3</h3>
<p>A prospective employer navigates to the website using the url found on my CV/resume. They are automatically taken to the home page which lists a short welcome and brief bio. Using the navigation bar located below the header banner and obove the main content, the employer navigates to the CV page to contrast to the submitted CV. The page loads with strictly text information organized using a table.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
  <p>The target audience will be composed of students, peers, and employers who are looking to gather information about me or contact me. The website will be used to provide relevant information on my lectures, publications, events, and email contact. The website would also function to drive traffic to where books could be purchased from the publisher.</p>
  <h3>Reference Websites</h3>  
<h3>Good Examples</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://vaclavsmil.com/">Vilac Smil's</a> website has a great example of the clean look and navigation I would like to use.
	<li><a href="http://www.callieschweitzer.com/bio">Callie Schweitzer</a> has a great looking website that with a clearly marked and simple bio page I would like to mimic.
	<li><a href="http://www.laurenicolesmith.com/">Lauren Smiths'</a> website provides a contact link right at the bottom of the homepage.
  </ul>
<h3>Bad Examples</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.sleepdiplomat.com">Sleep Diplomat</a> website offers a bad example of contact information. No contanct page nor in the footer... where is it?
	<li><a href="http://ianenders.com/">Ian Enders'</a>  website is not a bad website on its own. It is unique and great for its audience. However, it would not work well for mine.
</ul>
<hr>	  
 <h2>Presentation Information</h2>
    
   <h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
   <p>The website will contain one home page and four seperate main pages all accessible from the navigation bar. The site hierarchy will be very shallow with links from the 4 main pages only sending users to outside pages off my server space.</p>

<h3>Wireframe of Website Organization</h3>
<p> The website will contain the following main pages:</p> 
<ul>
	<li> <a href="Home.JPG">Home Page</a>
	<li> <a href="Bio.JPG">Bio</a>
	<li> <a href="Publications.JPG">Publications</a>
	<li> <a href="Events.JPG">Events</a>
 	<li> <a href="News.JPG">News</a>
</ul>  
<h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
<p>I will attempt to make the website as clean and simple as possible. The target audience will likely be visiting the site on a case by case basis and will not likely revisit often. Visitors will be looking for specific information so the tool is meant to isimply inform with as little effort or confusion as possible. For this reason I want the design to be shallow with clear navigation via an identical navigation bar on every page with links leading to the five main pages without subpages.</p>
  
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Most of the images will either be provided by myself (pictures of myself, my work, etc.), available in the public domain, or by publishers and event sponsors with permission.</p>
  
<h3>Color Scheme</h3>
<p>My color scheme will be based on 3 approaches. Rule number 1 provided by <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/how-to-choose-color-for-your-website/"> Connie Gilmore <a/> is "never choose a background that makes your text or content hard to read". Reading the information is vital to my website, so I would first like a well defined contrast between the text and background. Then, as stated by <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/website-color-scheme/"> Neil Patel <a>I need to "focus on the audience". So I will use colors that display a clean and professional apperance. Lastly, I will use colors to envoke emotions that produce calm.</p>
<ul>
	<li>My backround color will be <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/eae9e9">light grey</a>
		<li>My font color will be <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/2b2a2a">black</a></li>
		<li>Accent colors will be shades of <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/b8b8b8">grey</a>
</ul>
